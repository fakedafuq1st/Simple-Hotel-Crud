if you need to create a simple hotel website using PHP and SQL for the database, this might be what you need.

# Information (for some reason)
Title     : Simple Hotel with Crud

Language  : PHP

Database  : MySQL

you might need to use any text editor for code editing such as notepad++ or visual studio code and XAMPP for running the code.


# How To Use (for some reason)
For literally 0 experience (like in my case, i rarely see people giving detailed instruction on how to use the code so i might provide this. maybe useful for some people)

for installing the app or code
1. download XAMPP and install it,
2. get this code (i'm choosing to download the code entirely, i honestly don't know how to properly repo a code)
3. extract the code to your XAMP htdocs folder (usually on C:/XAMPP/HTDOCS) 
4. go to phpmyadmin and install hotel(1).sql for the database.
5. for the connection, set it up on koneksi.php
6. run xampp and you're all set.


# That's it!
if i missed something, i don't know give a comments or something this is my first project.
enjoy.
